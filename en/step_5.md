## Run on boot

Your code needs to run as soon as the Raspberry Pi starts up. 

You can control what programs run when the system boots with `systemd`.

**Note** `systemd` is only available from Jessie versions of the Raspbian OS.

--- task ---

Open Terminal and type:

```bash
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/tripwire.service
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Define a new unit called 'Laser Tripwire' and set it to run after the multi-user environment is available. 

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Laser Tripwire
After=multi-user.target
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Configure the service.

Set the `Type` to 'idle' so the 'ExecStart' command runs only when everything else has loaded.

Set the `ExecStart` parameter to the command to run.

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Laser Tripwire
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=idle
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/username/tripwire.py
```

**Note** Change `username` to your username!

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add a `WantedBy` directive set to 'multi-user.target', so a directory called multi-user.target.wants is created within /etc/systemd/system (if not already available) and a symbolic link to the your unit is placed within. Disabling your unit removes the link and the dependency relationship.

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Laser Tripwire
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=idle
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/username/tripwire.py

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---

Save and exit nano by pressing `Ctrl + x` and then typing `y` when you are prompted to save.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Set the permission on the unit file to `644`.

```bash
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/tripwire.service
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Tell systemd to start your unit file during the boot sequence.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable tripwire.service
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test**: Reboot your Raspberry Pi to check your service runs.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

--- /task ---
